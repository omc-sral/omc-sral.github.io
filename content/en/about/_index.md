The Opto-Mechatronic Component & System Reliability Analysis Lab was
established by Kuan-Jung Chung, PhD in 2005 with the mission of
enhancing the reliability of opto-mechatronic components and systems,
aiming to create products with higher added value.  It seeks to
promote a culture of research into the reliability of opto-mechatronic
components and systems while assisting related industries in upgrading
their technological capabilities.  In recent years, building on years
of accumulated experience in reliability prediction research and
development, the lab has introduced AI prediction technologies into
smart manufacturing and medical applications.  This further supports
enterprises in their digital and green transformations, preparing them
for sustainable operations amidst the significant challenges brought
by industrial postmodernization.
